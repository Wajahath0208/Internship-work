            <h3>Adams Henry</h3>
            <p>“The food was excellent and so was the service.  I had the mushroom risotto with scallops which was awesome. My wife had a burger over greens (gluten-free) which was also very good. They were very conscientious about gluten allergies. The restaurant has a vey nice ambiance and a cozy bar.” </p>

            <h3>Dwayne John</h3>
           
            <p> Excellent food. Menu is extensive and seasonal to a particularly high standard. Definitely fine dining. It can be expensive but worth it and they do different deals on different nights so it’s worth checking them out before you book. Highly recommended.</p>
